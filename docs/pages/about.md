# **About Me**

**My Story:**  
Hi! My name is Victoria, but I go by Vika (vee-kah) for short, and I was born and raised in Freehold, NJ. At Pomona College, I’m double majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science with a self-designed concentration in Human-Computer Interaction.  

My desire for understanding people through cognition is what led me to Cognitive Science, and in this exploration of cognition I began to recognize the elaborate, complex systems that our mental processes consist of.  

This growing understanding of the intricate systems our brains are composed of got me into computation— but I still wanted to retain the human aspect of computation that drove me to it. In human-computer interaction, what drives me is discovering ways to use these computational aspects to ‘decipher’ people and facilitate new means of human interaction.  

I came to college with the intention of learning how to develop creative solutions that expand people’s access to tools and opportunities they might otherwise never have had. CS has been giving me the instruments to realize this passion. Once I took my first CS class at Pomona, it clicked: computer science is how I can actually build the tools I used to only daydream about— tools shaped by real human behaviors, not just what a computer finds convenient.  

**My passions for giving back:**  
I was raised by a single immigrant mother who instilled in me a deep belief in the power of higher education. As someone who didn’t have access to higher education, she emphasized its power to open doors to worlds of opportunity she could only dream of. So for me, completing this mission of getting into a good college was an incredible accomplishment, especially doing so without the resources or guidance that other students receive from external tutors.  

Getting into college was the fulfillment of this family mission proposed by my mother, but the personal accomplishment I’m even more proud of is what came after: finally having access to academic and institutional resources for the first time allowed me to grow and give back in ways I never could before. I became a research assistant and teaching assistant in the Computer Science department, and a mentor through Pomona’s First-Generation Low Income program— all roles that allowed me to give back by supporting students who share backgrounds similar to mine. Helping others reach milestones they once thought were out of reach has become one of the most meaningful parts of my college experience, and it’s what I consider my greatest personal accomplishment.
